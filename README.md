This repository is the basic code for socket programming.

* **Socket Programming:** Socket Programming is a programming that uses Socket as a channel used for transmitting data between machines or programs. It may be between the server and the client, which can be transmitted both ways and the state of each contact can be kept. While if it is REST transmission, it will not remember the state of each contact. And the communication must start from one side only

## Method of Use
There are two main methods of implementation there are two main ways to apply the code to further use or study.

* **Direct Download:** You can download them directly through our Repository page.
* **Github Software:** You will need to download Github to your computer. After that, open Terminal and run the command ``` git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/stringtheory-th/Initiation-socket.git socket-dev ```

## Libraries related to this use
In our code we use a library that is a low-level networking interface that is perfect for practice.

```python
import socket 
```
